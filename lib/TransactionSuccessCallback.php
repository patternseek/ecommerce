 * Used in place of a closure as it needs to be serialised.

 * Usage:
 * 
 * class MyCallback extends TransactionSuccessCallback{
 *      public function __invoke( Transaction $txn, Basket $basket ){
 *          //.. Do something with $txn, $basket and $this->variables
 *      }
 * } 
 * 
 * $callback = new TransactionSuccessCallback( ['neededVariable'=>$neededVariable, 'otherVariable'=>$other ] );
 * Then pass to the Basket component via the 'transactionSuccessCallback' property of the updateProps() method. 
 * 
 * Note that the $variables property will have been serialised so won't maintain references to live variables.
 * If the Basket is embedded in anothe ViewComponent then fresh data can be fetched from that via $basket->getParent()
